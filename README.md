# Jonas Danilevicius Photography page

Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my first photography website for potencial customers and educational purpose. 



## UX
My goal in the design was to make it responsive and intuitive to access information on the site.
The dark blue color scheme works great as a frame for images and gives more modern feel. 

For customers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly design. This way,
they would be able to get to know me, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose. 
In the 'portfolio' section, I wanted them to show work that I've done, so they will be able to see what style i have taking pictures.
A link to my instagram and facebook accounts were also provided for their ease of access. 


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3)


## Features
This site uses the navigation bar for quick and easy change between pages in my website.
On the main page navbar is sticked to the top and it's transperent. the idea behind that, is to make homepage simple as possible, the viewer 
points the attention straight to the car image. 
The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.


## Testing
In the about me section, they can read a bit about me, my passion to cars and photography. If they're viewing on a desktop, on the left 
they will see photo of me, and on the right side the text.
On the mobile version the image apears above the text.

In the portfolio section they are able to see some of my last taken images, i used "BaguetteBox" to create responsive image gallery.
it works on desktop and mobile phone with no issues and gives beautiful effect, plus you can view images in full resolution to see all the
details.


They are also able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. 

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, 
the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. 
If all field are valid, the page will reload. If an customers is interested in contacting me, they will have to fill out all 
fields in order for the form to go through.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'.
All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

By clicking on the links in the navbar, they will open in same tab, that will make more sense, because you still navigate in same website.
on the navbar active link will be a different color, so viewer always knows where he is on the website.
Mobile phone version works the same, just to safe space navbar menu becomes "burger menu". 

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices 
(Huawei,  Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, everything worked fine.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new
commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.
